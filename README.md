# Automatic-Sudoku-Solver-using-pygame
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. This sudoku game is developed using pygame library and automated using backtracking algorithm

## Features implemented

## Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity of backtracking algorithm is ```O(N^(N * N))``` where N is the grid size <br/>
Space complexity is ```O(N * N)```
