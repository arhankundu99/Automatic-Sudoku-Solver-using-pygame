# Backtracking Visualiser

## Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. This sudoku game is developed using pygame library and automated using backtracking algorithm

### Features implemented
1) **Game Interface to Play** <br/>
2) **Auto solving** <br/>
3) **Visualization of auto solving i.e., Backtracking Algorithm visualization** <br/>
4) **Options: Reset, Clear game** <br/>
5) **Manual Solving** <br/>

### Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity of backtracking algorithm is ```O(N^(N * N))``` where N is the grid size <br/>
Space complexity is ```O(N * N)```

## N Queen
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal
